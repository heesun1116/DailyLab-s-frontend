# Daily Lab's

## 01. Project background
The Daily Lab is a service that was made with my friend’s college lab life motif. They write five sentences of research every day and also evaluate the achievement of that day. So I build this service by using React and Redux for the frontend, Node.js for the back-end, Mongo DB for Database. The Daily Lab was carried out while studying the blog-making project in the book.
Also, I got a simple and intuitive UI/UX Design concept. This concept makes the User see Cancel changesand write the post intuitively. 

## 02. Project feature

We can see a similar feature like Instagram on ‘Heestagram’.
