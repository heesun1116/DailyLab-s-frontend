# Daily Lab's

## 01. Project background 🔎

The Daily Lab is a service that was made with my friend’s college lab life motif. They write five sentences of research every day and also evaluate the achievement of that day. So I build this service by using React and Redux for the frontend, Node.js for the back-end, Mongo DB for Database. The Daily Lab was carried out while studying the blog-making project in the book.
Also, I got a simple and intuitive UI/UX Design concept. This concept makes the User see Cancel changesand write the post intuitively. 

## 02. Project feature 📄

The Daily Lab feature is similar to the blog. ✏️
- Login/Regiser/Log out
- Write Post
- Delete Post 
- Rewrite Post
- See Post
- See my Post
- Search the Post by tag
- Upload avatar can be allowed when the User signs up only. If Users don't upload their avatar, they won't be able to sign up. 
The reason for this is that we identify the user by the avatar from each other apparently.

## 03. Project Design 🎨

I designed the Daily Labs so that users can see the five sentences and achievements they wrote every day.
Users can identify the achievement by the color(ex. Alice blue -good)
Also, the concept is simple and modern. I chose the color to give an intelligent and friendly feeling.
Logo design means that the effort made by every day can be the one we want and achieve.
