# Daily Lab's

## 01. Project background
The Daily Lab is a service that was made with my friend’s college lab life motif. They write five sentences of research every day and also evaluate the achievement of that day. So I build this service by using React and Redux for the frontend, Node.js for the back-end, Mongo DB for Database. The Daily Lab was carried out while studying the blog-making project in the book.
Also, I got a simple and intuitive UI/UX Design concept. This concept makes the User see Cancel changesand write the post intuitively. 

## 02. Project feature

The Daily Lab feature is similar to the blog. ✏️
- Login/Regiser/Log out
- Write Post
- Delete Post 
- Rewrite Post
- See Post
- See my Post
- Search the Post by tag
- Upload avatar can be allowed when the User signs up only. If Users don't upload their avatar, they won't be able to sign up. 
The reason for this is that we identify the user by the avatar from each other apparently.

## 03. Project Design

‘Hee stagram' design concept is simple and friendly. 
The meaning of the Logo is that communicate with my friends every day.
Through the  gradation of color, I tried to express the diversity
